			<p id="main">Last Friday, we held "Club Flex at Hays HS and it was a huge success! What is "Club Flex?" It is an opportunity for students to choose from over 140 activities to learn and grow as a person. We have everything from cooking, corn hole, Playdough and drawing clubs. I am proud of our kids for taking a risk to meet others who share their same interests and get out of their comfort zone to learn new things. Also a big shout out to all of our HHS teachers, 100% of our teachers sponsor a club this semester to engage our kids!</p>
			<p id="sidebar">Congratulations to the Hays HS PTSA! We were awarded the following awards by the Hays Council of PTA's earlier this week: recognized for having 100+ members, for fall 2018 membership increase and received the President's Award!</p>

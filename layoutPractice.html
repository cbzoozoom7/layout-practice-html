			<p>These stuffed peppers are lovely as a starter, or as a side dish for a Chinese meal. They also go down well as part of a buffet and even children seem to like them</p>
			<p>Heat the oil in a wok. Add the garlic and stir fry until golden.</p>
			<p>Reduce the heat down and then add the ginger and the mince. Stir fry until this is nicely browned then add the other ingredients (apart from the peppers). Stir fry all of this together for a minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</p>
			<p>Core and remote the seeds of the jenners and put them into maters</p>
